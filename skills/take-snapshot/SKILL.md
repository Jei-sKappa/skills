# Take Snapshot

Given an existing codebase, produce a single Markdown snapshot that a separate team could rebuild from — in the same stack or a different one — without consulting the original code. The document is a hybrid **Software Requirements Specification** (loosely IEEE 830 / ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018) and **Product Requirements Document**: product framing on top, functional and non-functional requirements with stable IDs in the middle, technical architecture and business rules at the bottom, open questions consolidated at the end.

The document is a **frozen snapshot** of the application at the moment the skill runs. It describes what currently exists; it does not track what was, what's planned, or what was deprecated. A later run on the same codebase produces a fresh, independent snapshot.

The skill's value is **coverage and traceability**, not stylistic polish. Bugs of omission in the snapshot become bugs in the rebuild. Bias toward completeness over speed; this skill is expected to be slow.

## What this skill is — and isn't

- **Do**: read the source, infer what the app currently does, write the snapshot, flag what cannot be determined from code as Open Questions.
- **Don't**: write any code, edit any file outside the snapshot output path, refactor "while we're here", or run anything destructive. This skill is **read-only with respect to the source codebase**.
- **Stack-agnostic on both sides**: never mention or assume the source technology (framework, language, build system) or any target rebuild technology. The document describes *what the app does*, not *how to port it*. The one exception: the methodology preamble's *what was inspected* list may name an artifact when the name itself is load-bearing context for the inspection (e.g. "iOS Info.plist parsed for declared capabilities") — and even then, lean toward describing the artifact, not the technology.
- **No migration content**: never include sections titled "Migration Notes", "Implementation Hints", "Rebuild Considerations", "Source → Target Mapping", or any equivalent. That ground is explicitly out of scope. A source→target mapping would lock the document to one rebuild target and shorten its useful life — let the rebuild project produce its own mapping doc separately.
- **No history, no deprecation**: the snapshot describes only what exists now. No "previously did X" notes, no `[DEPRECATED]` markers, no change logs versus a prior run. If a feature isn't in the code right now, it isn't in the snapshot.
- **Single file**: always one Markdown file. No master index, no per-area splits, no companion files.
- **Honest about fidelity**: a "1:1 rebuild" is bounded by what's observable in the code plus what humans answer in the Open Questions section. Say so in the methodology preamble; never paper over it.
- **No screenshots or visual flows**: where the document needs one, leave a placeholder for a human to attach (e.g. "see attached screen flow for FR-0042 — to be added by author").

## Orchestrator role

The agent receiving the request becomes the **orchestrator**. The orchestrator plans angles, dispatches exploration subagents in parallel, then writes the snapshot from their notes.

The orchestrator does **no** first-hand reading of the source codebase. Every search, listing, file read, or `grep` against the source goes through a subagent — without exception, including trivial repo-root listings and top-level manifest files. The orchestrator's tools touch only its own scratch outputs (the run folder's `.metadata.json` and the notes files written by subagents) and the final snapshot output path. This is what keeps the orchestrator's context window clean enough to maintain global consistency across the whole document (IDs, cross-references, holistic phrasing).

Subagents never feed information back through their reply. They write to disk and acknowledge; the orchestrator reads the file on disk. The reply is treated as a no-op signal — useful only to know the subagent has returned, never as content. If a notes file is missing after a subagent reports success, the orchestrator re-spawns the subagent with the same brief and waits for the file to appear on disk. The reply is never trusted as a source of truth; the file on disk is the only signal that work is complete.

The writer is the orchestrator itself. Document writing is **serialized**, never parallelized, because FR/NFR IDs must remain globally unique within the document.

## Output structure

The primary artifact:

```
<cwd>/APP_SPECIFICATION.md      # default; overridable via prompt
```

Exploration notes (durable evidence trail; useful for human verification and audit):

```
<cwd>/docs/take-snapshot/
└── YYYY-MM-DD_NN/              # one folder per run; date + per-day index separated by `_`
    ├── .metadata.json          # started_at, source_root, output_path, scope_filter, skill_version
    ├── 00-survey.md            # high-level overview produced in Step 2
    ├── 01-<angle>/             # one folder per exploration angle
    │   └── notes.md            # findings, evidence, draft requirements
    ├── 02-<angle>/
    │   └── notes.md
    └── ...
```

If a snapshot already exists at the output path from a previous run, treat it as historical: the new run **overwrites** it. The notes folder uses a date-stamped subfolder so prior evidence trails are preserved alongside their (now overwritten) document, in case the user wants to compare manually. Mention the overwrite in the final message.

## Document template

The snapshot's section-by-section template — section order, per-section content rules, and the FR/NFR item format — lives in `references/document-template.md`. The writer reads it at the start of Step 4 and follows it exactly.

## ID assignment

Inside a single document run:

- Assign IDs sequentially in document order: the first FR written gets `FR-0001`, the second `FR-0002`, and so on. Same for NFRs.
- IDs are global across the document. Grouping FRs by feature area with `###` subheadings is a presentation choice; the numbering does not reset per area.
- Once assigned, an ID must remain stable through the rest of the same writing pass so the **Notes** cross-references and the **Open Questions** back-references resolve correctly.

There is no cross-run ID stability requirement. A re-run produces a fresh snapshot with fresh IDs.

## Exploration Plan

The orchestrator dispatches one subagent per applicable angle. The catalog below is the **starting set** — pick the angles that actually apply to this codebase. A frontend-only repo doesn't need a database-schema angle; a backend repo doesn't need a screen-inventory angle. Add fresh angles when the codebase has surfaces this list doesn't cover (e.g. ML model registry, hardware integrations, payment flows complex enough to warrant their own angle).

Default catalog:

1. **Navigation & screens** — route map, screen inventory, navigation graph, deep links, modals, layouts.
2. **State & domain logic** — state containers, reducers, business logic modules, computed values, derivations.
3. **Data model & persistence** — entities, relationships, local storage layers, caches, sync mechanisms.
4. **External integrations** — API clients, endpoints consumed, request/response shapes, third-party SDKs, webhooks.
5. **Authentication & authorization** — login flows, session handling, token storage, role/permission checks, gated routes.
6. **Configuration surface** — environment variables, runtime config, feature flags, A/B experiment toggles visible in code.
7. **Platform & manifests** — declared permissions, capabilities, push notifications, background tasks, OS-level integrations.
8. **Localization & accessibility** — i18n catalogs, locale switching, RTL handling, ARIA semantics, focus management.
9. **Cross-cutting UX** — theming, design tokens, error boundaries, loading and empty states, toast/notification patterns.
10. **Build, CI, and deployment surface** — what artifacts are produced, what targets are built, CI pipeline stages (without naming the toolchain in the snapshot — describe outputs).
11. **Non-functional signals** — timeouts, debounces, retry policies, cache TTLs, logging levels, telemetry endpoints, performance hints baked into the code.
12. **Business rules** — validation, calculation formulas, state machines, eligibility rules, quota and throttling logic.

Each angle's notes feed sections of the document; the same finding may inform multiple sections (e.g. an API client integration shows up in both External integrations and FRs about features consuming it). The orchestrator handles cross-referencing during writing.

## Procedure

Run the process as numbered steps. Steps run in order; **inside a step**, subagents run in parallel and the orchestrator waits for them all to return before advancing.

### Step 1 — Bootstrap

1. **Parse arguments** (any of these may be in the user's prompt; defaults shown):
   - `output_path`: default `<cwd>/APP_SPECIFICATION.md`.
   - `source_root`: default `<cwd>`. May be a subdirectory if the user wants a scoped snapshot.
   - `scope_filter`: optional path glob(s) restricting which files exploration may inspect.

2. **Resolve the run folder**: `<cwd>/docs/take-snapshot/YYYY-MM-DD_NN`. List existing same-date runs and pick the next zero-padded 2-digit index (`01` if none, otherwise `02`, …). Separate date and index with `_`. `mkdir -p` the folder.

3. **Write `.metadata.json`**:
   ```json
   {
     "started_at": <epoch seconds>,
     "skill_version": "<from this skill's frontmatter>",
     "source_root": "<absolute path>",
     "output_path": "<absolute path>",
     "scope_filter": "<glob or null>"
   }
   ```

4. **If a file already exists at `output_path`**, note that it will be overwritten — do not read it for ID continuity. Each run is independent.

### Step 2 — Survey

The orchestrator dispatches a **survey subagent** — always, regardless of repo size, because the orchestrator never reads the source directly. The subagent performs a quick high-level pass (repo root listing, top-level manifest/config files, project shape, top-level folders) and writes `<run-folder>/00-survey.md` capturing:

- Project shape and top-level layout.
- Candidate feature areas (folder names, route prefixes, package names).
- Which angles from the catalog apply, which don't, and any fresh angles to add.

After the subagent returns, the orchestrator **verifies `00-survey.md` exists on disk**. If it doesn't, re-spawn the survey subagent with the same brief. Re-spawn as many times as needed until the file is on disk.

The orchestrator then reads `00-survey.md` from disk to extract the planned angles, and appends them to `.metadata.json` under a `planned_angles` field so the run is auditable later.

### Step 3 — Parallel exploration

Dispatch one subagent per planned angle in a single tool call. Each subagent writes to `<run-folder>/NN-<angle-slug>/notes.md`.

After every subagent in a batch has returned, the orchestrator **verifies each expected `notes.md` exists on disk** under its angle folder. If any file is missing — for any reason, including a subagent that reported success — re-spawn that subagent with the same brief. Re-spawn as many times as needed until every expected file is on disk.

If the number of angles is too large to dispatch in one parallel batch reliably, split into smaller batches — but never collapse Step 3 into Step 4. All exploration finishes before any writing starts.

Do **not** read the notes files during Step 3. Reading is deferred to Step 4 so it can be done sequentially in a single, predictable order.

### Step 4 — Writing

The orchestrator (writer is the orchestrator itself; **never delegated to a subagent**, because global ID consistency depends on a single writer) composes the document from the notes:

1. **Read the notes files one at a time, in numerical order** of the angle folder prefix — `00-survey.md` first, then `01-<angle>/notes.md`, then `02-<angle>/notes.md`, and so on. Use a separate Read call per file; do not batch reads in parallel. This sequential intake gives the orchestrator a predictable, ordered build-up of context.
2. Once **all** notes are read, read `references/document-template.md` and write the document's sections in the order it defines — methodology preamble first, Open Questions last — assigning `FR-XXXX` / `NFR-XXXX` IDs sequentially as requirements are written.
3. Cross-reference: every Trace pointer should be a real file path or route, ideally with a line number when it sharpens the reference. Every Open Question should cross-reference the FRs/NFRs/rules that depend on it.
4. Write the final document in one pass to the `output_path`, overwriting any prior file there.

### Step 5 — Final message

A short message to the user, under 10 lines:

- Output path written (and a note if it overwrote an existing file).
- Run folder path (so the user can audit the notes that fed the snapshot).
- Summary: number of FRs, NFRs, business rules, open questions.
- One sentence reminding the user that Open Questions is the next thing to triage with PMs/backend engineers, and that visual flows / screenshots must be attached by a human (the skill cannot produce them from code).
- Skill version that produced this run.

End the message with exactly one terminal line: `Outcome: DONE — Snapshot written: <output_path>`.

## Subagent briefs

The orchestrator never inherits a subagent's session and never loads a subagent's notes back into its own context (it reads the notes from disk in Step 4).

### Survey subagent (Step 2)

Dispatched on every run, regardless of repo size — the orchestrator never reads the source directly, so the survey subagent is the only way the orchestrator gets a view of the repo's shape.

- **Source root** — absolute path.
- **Scope filter** — glob if any, otherwise none.
- **Output path** — `<run-folder>/00-survey.md`.
- **Output shape** — markdown with `## Project shape`, `## Top-level layout`, `## Candidate feature areas`, `## Recommended angles`, `## Notes` (anything surprising — e.g. apparent dead code, multiple apps in one repo, signs of an in-progress feature that's only partially wired up).
- **Hard constraints** — read-only on the source. Read directories and config files at the top two levels only; do **not** descend deeply. No code edits, no destructive commands.
- **Return contract** — write the file and reply with a single short acknowledgment (e.g. `done`). Do **not** include a summary, the file path, or any content from the survey. The orchestrator does not parse the reply — it reads the file from disk during Step 2's verification step.

### Exploration subagent (Step 3, one per angle)

- **Angle** — single angle name and a one-sentence framing of what the angle covers.
- **Source root** and **scope filter** — same as Step 2.
- **Output path** — `<run-folder>/NN-<angle-slug>/notes.md`. The subagent `mkdir -p`s the angle folder.
- **Output shape** — markdown with these sections:
  - `## Findings` — what this angle reveals about the application. Bulleted, concrete, observable.
  - `## Evidence` — file paths (with line numbers when useful) backing each finding.
  - `## Draft requirements` — proposed FR/NFR items in the item format from `references/document-template.md` (give the subagent that file's absolute path so it can read the format itself), **without** final IDs (use `ID: TBD` as a placeholder). The writer will assign IDs in Step 4.
  - `## Open questions` — anything this angle surfaces that code cannot answer. The writer will consolidate.
  - `## Cross-references` — pointers to other angles whose findings this likely overlaps with, so the writer can merge cleanly.
- **Discipline** —
  - Read the code thoroughly within the angle's scope. Multi-pass is fine; this skill is not optimizing for latency.
  - Never invent behavior. If a finding can't be traced to a file, omit it or move it to Open Questions.
  - Never name source-stack or target-stack technologies in the body of draft requirements. Describe behavior, not implementation. ("Persists session across app restarts" — yes. "Uses Redux Persist with localStorage" — no.)
  - Never include code snippets in draft requirements. Evidence can cite snippets; requirements must be stack-neutral prose.
- **Hard constraints** — read-only on the source codebase. No writes outside the angle folder. No code edits anywhere.
- **Return contract** — write the file and reply with a single short acknowledgment (e.g. `done`). Do **not** include a summary, the file path, or any content from the notes. The orchestrator does not parse the reply — it reads the file from disk in Step 4.

The orchestrator dispatches one of these per planned angle, in parallel.

## When the codebase is too thin

If the source is so sparse that meaningful angles can't run (empty repo, scaffolding only, mostly generated code), still produce a snapshot — but make it honest:

- A short methodology preamble.
- A `## Product overview` that says the source does not yet express enough to infer product framing.
- A populated `## Open Questions` listing what the author/team must answer for the snapshot to be filled in.
- Empty FR/NFR sections explicitly marked as such, not omitted, so the reader knows the exploration ran and found nothing rather than that those sections were forgotten.

Better to return a 200-line honest skeleton than a 2000-line fabrication.
